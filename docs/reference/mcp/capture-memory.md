**Capture a memory**

Record a point-in-time fact into the mnema chain, attributed to this agent and pinned to the current session. Optionally pick the scope it lands in: public (team-visible), private (this machine, this project), or global (personal, cross-project); omitted, it follows the session default (private for an agent in a project, global outside one). Optionally pick the project it lands in, when the workspace holds more than one. The reply says which tree it landed in. RECORDING IS PERMANENT: mnema is append-only and nothing deletes a fact. A record in the public scope is committed to the repository and reaches every machine that clones it (published, if that repository is public). So do NOT record credentials here. Values in a recognized format (cloud keys, API tokens, private keys, a password inside a URL) are replaced with a typed placeholder before anything is written and the reply says what was replaced, but a format mnema does not recognize is written verbatim and cannot be taken back. Do not record personal data either: an email address is replaced with &lt;email> and reported, and the mnid already says who wrote. Each text field holds at most 65536 bytes; a longer one is refused, not truncated.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | What it is |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- |
| `content` | string, at least 1 character | yes | The memory to record. |
| `scope` | one of `public`, `private`, `global` | no | Where the memory lands; overrides the session default. |
| `project` | string, at least 1 character | no | Which project of this workspace the fact belongs to: its absolute path, as this server gave it; a bare name is refused. Omitted, it lands in the project this session resolved to (the one `bootstrap` names). Pass it whenever the work being recorded happened in a different project of this workspace. |

## Annotations

| Hint | Value |
| --- | :---: |
| `readOnlyHint` | false |
| `destructiveHint` | false |
| `idempotentHint` | false |
